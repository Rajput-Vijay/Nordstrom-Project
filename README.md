Good day, everyone! I hope you're all doing well. I'm making this blog to tell you about my entire team's experience of cloning (this website) during our first construct week. We got a total of 15 days to complete this job.

What is construct week and what is its purpose? Construct week is an element of Masai School's curriculum that allows us to explore and apply all of the topics we've learned in class. By putting all of our skills to work on a project, we learn a lot about how things actually work and how to apply our knowledge to effective use. The primary objective of this activity is to acquire these front-end skills by creating replicas of these websites as identical as possible.

Practising does not make you perfect, but it does bring you closer to being perfect.
We are team Nordstrom and in our team, there are 6 members including me.

Nordstrom.com Nordstrom, Inc. is an American luxury department store chain. Where users can buy everything from clothes to shoes.

We implemented the following strategy:
On the day we received this project, we decided to hold a meeting with all of the team members and began analyzing and breaking down the components of the entire website. I divided the work among the team members after breaking it down into chunks. And then started working towards the goal and made a proper routine and time to complete the particular task.



In the end, I would like to thank Masai for this project and also a big thanks to my whole because, despite the fact that it was a challenging task, it was accomplished due to my team, who put theirs all into this project. We had the chance to learn a lot throughout the project and brush up on our abilities along the way. I really believe cloning these websites really helped everyone in understanding the concepts as well as applying those concepts in real practical use. Cloning websites requires a lot of analytical thought as you break down designs from bigger to smaller components. We learned about the importance of teamwork and the strength it possesses. We were anxious on day one about completing such a large task in the allotted time, but we eventually accomplished our target. Thank you for reading.
